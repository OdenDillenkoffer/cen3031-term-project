## Contributing
1. Fork the main repository by clicking the `Fork` button at the top right
2. Using your favorite git interface, clone this new repository. Through the terminal this is done with `git clone <repo-link.git>`
3. Make changes. Try to make commits after each small change, so that way your work can be tracked and reverted easily if need be.
4. **Sync your fork before the next step to prevent merge conflicts**
5. Push your changes to your repository. Now they are on GitHub.
6. Create a Pull Request (PR) via GitHub, from your repository to the main branch of the main repository. If your fork is synced, then your changes should merge automatically :)
